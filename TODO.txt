 - support source packages, including references to source control as
   a form of a source package.

 - be a bit more careful about what we sign.  In particular, when you

   added.  Potentially should even sign the .pm3 files.

 - dh-make-git helper;
     dh-make-git --repo git://myrepo.example.com/repos.git \
     	--upload ssh://poe -r distname -g groupname

 - make the current package groups files a little less
   proof-of-concept-y.
